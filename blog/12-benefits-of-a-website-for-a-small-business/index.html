        <h2>12 Benefits Of A Website For A Small Business</h2>
<h3>Table of content</h3>
<pre><code>1. Introduction
2. Increase Your Online Presence
3. Get Useful Insight And Data
</code></pre>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<h3>2. Increase Your Online Presence</h3>
<p>You are online right now aren't you? Your potential customers or clients probably are too. It is therefore wise to reach out to your potential buyers or clients where they are.</p>
<p>A recent study in January 2021 shows that <strong>4.67 billion</strong> people which is <strong>59.5% of the global population</strong> are active internet users. And <strong>92.6% (4.32 billion) are mobile users</strong>. Just think of the difference a fraction of this traffic can do to your business. It is life changing of course.</p>
<p>Marketing your products or services to this large audience will increase your sales exponentially. Only if done correctly of course. A shot in the dark will get you undesirable results or no results at all.</p>
<p>It's up to you if you will take action to claim your share of the goldmine the internet has for you.</p>
<h3>3. Get Useful Insight And Data</h3>
<p>Without data you are just another person with an opinion.<br>
A website will help you gain insights that can be very profitable to any kind of business. This are data that is hard of impossible to collect in a brick and motar setting.<br>
With a website you can get know:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique visitors</li>
<li>Returning visitors</li>
<li>How many cart abandonments</li>
<li>Demograhy on your visitors</li>
<li>Geograhic locations of your visitors</li>
<li>Did they use a desktop or mobile</li>
<li>The content they are interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>This information can easily be acquired by the right web analytics techniques and is very useful in making important business decisions. Gathering it in a physical location is quite a challenge as you can imagine. I have a few ideas though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse CCTV footage of your business - That requires a lot of time and effort which is better used to do more productive tasks</li>
<li>Ask every new visitor a couple of questions and record in a book or excel sheet - Is that even practical? Nobody even got time for that.<br>
My point here is you should let the website do the tedious job for you as you carry out the most important duties of your business. And make more money as a bonus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Extension Of Your Existing Promotion Media</h3>
<p>Let's say you not new to the idea of marketing and you have a few tools in your arsenal that you have been using. Maybe you have banners, bronchures, t-shirts, mugs, calendars, television ads etc. Adding your business website to them will make your marketing effort more effective. The amount of information a banner, t-shirt or anything else you use is vey limited. The airtime you can acquire in television or radio is limited as well. But if potential customer can get your website out everything from your media, then you can lead them to somewhere you can communicate in details as possible.</p>
<p>If your existing promotion methods work for you, don't abandon them. Just supercharge them by extending their functionalities to make them even more effective and profitable.</p>
<h3>5. A 24/7/365 Showroom For Your Business</h3>
<p>For instance a shop has open and closing hours and is managed by normal people who have limited energy to operate them. It also needs floor space and shelves for the products to occupie. But such problems are non existent in a website.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need shelves or floor space to showcase you products</li>
<li>You have virtually unlimited space to list your products in whichever manner pleases you</li>
<li>Your products are there to be accessed at any time. There is no downtime for your products display</li>
</ul>
<p>More interestingly you can also showcase you itangible products.<br>
Let's say you are destist. It is impossible to demonstrate to every potential client how you perfom your surgeries all day and night for them to be make a decision. But you can have a single professionally done video of you doing your best work on the homepage of your website. That way you will be marketing yourself whether you are sleeping, working or even enjoying your vacation in Hawai.</p>
<h3>6. Build Authority And Reputation</h3>
<p>The only reason clients will spend their money on your product or service is because they have a problem that they want to solve.<br>
If you educate your prospects on how to solve a problem that is nagging them, they will will consider you as an authority in your field and they are more likely to buy from you. They also believe that you have their best interest at heart and you are not just some business around the corner looking to make a quick sale.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to show authority in your industry is to blog about useful solutions that a potential buyer might have that is related to your industry and business. This should not be difficult because you have experience in your field and potential buyers need it to solve their problems.</p>
<p>Survey shows that out of 61% of customers, blog influenced their decision to purchase. That means blogging and adding useful content in your website will skyrocket your business profits.</p>
